<h3>Note about bugs, backwards compatibility, etc.</h3>

<p>This program should always be backwards compatible.  In other words, you should never have to worry about updates accidentally messing up your ROM or your songs.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that your ROM crashes after using this program, a backup is always saved as ROMNAME~.  For example, "smw.smc~".  And for further protection, Lunar Magic automatically saves backups, so you're even more safe.  However, if a crash does happen, please report it so that it may be identified and fixed.</p>

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Carol, romi, Homing, 757, gocha, and loveemu labo (and likely others) for their work on this program's predecessors (Addmusic and AddmusicM) and other general music-related matters (such as loveemu labo's SPC disassembly and N-SPC documentation).  Their work was invaluable, and this program would not exist without them.</li>
	<li>Vitor Vilela and p4plus2 for specific help with certain technical matters.</li>
	<li>The people over at #imamusic for general support and feature suggestions.</li>
	<li>The far-too-many-to-count beta testers that kept this program from being a bug-ridden mess (and for being patient over the long development time!).</li>
	<li>Credit for Asar, which this program is used with, goes to Alcaro.</li>
	<li>And you, the user, for using the tool!</li>
