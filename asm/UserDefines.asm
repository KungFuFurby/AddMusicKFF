;The following ASM file is shared between the SPC700-side and SNES-side
;code. Some defines will only affect the SPC700 side, and some will only
;affect the SNES-side, but all of them are stored here for the sake of
;having them stored in a consistent location.

!PSwitchIsSFX = !false

;Default setting: !false
;---------------
; If you set this to true, then the P-switch song will be a sound effect
; instead of a song that interrupts the current music.
; Note, however, that it is hardcoded and cannot be changed unless you
; do it yourself.
; This also enables a hijack on the SNES side to account for the
; modification made on the SPC700-side.

!noSFX = !false

;Default setting: !false
;---------------
; Causes the sound driver to have no SFX-related code in it.

;---------------
!noiseFrequencySFXInstanceResolution = !false

;Default setting: !false
;---------------
; Requires SFX code to actually be present (!noSFX is false).
; Adds in code that resolves noise frequency conflicts between SFX
; instances.
; Not needed unless you're using noise SFX across more than one channel.
; Vanilla SMW doesn't use noise SFX across more than one channel.

!EnableNoteClipping = !false

;Default setting: !false
;---------------
; Setting this to !true causes hardware rate overflows to be limited at the
; maximum hardware rate (3FFFh). This should really only be used if you
; absolutely need it (eg. a vibrato that's just on the edge of the maximum
; hardware rate), as it takes slightly more computation to handle and can
; also break some tracks that use overflow for making interesting effects.
