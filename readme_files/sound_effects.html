<h1>Sound Effects</h1>

<h2>How to Insert Sound Effects</h2>

<p>Inserting custom sound effects is very similar to adding custom songs; add your custom sound effect file to either the <code>1DF9</code> or <code>1DFC</code> folder, add its filename to <code>Addmusic_sound effects.txt</code>, and you're done. If you added the file to <code>1DF9</code> folder, then you'd add the filename under the <code>SFX1DF9</code> section in <code>Addmusic_sound effects.txt</code>, and likewise for the <code>1DFC</code> folder.</p>
<p>The difference between each folder is which SPC channel it plays on; by default, <code>1DF9</code> plays on channel #6, and <code>1DFC</code> plays on channel #7. You can redefine the channel that each sound effect plays on by using the <code>!1DF9SFXChannel</code> and <code>!1DFCSFXChannel</code> defines in the <a href="../asm/UserDefines.asm" target="_blank">UserDefines.asm</a> file.</p>
<p>For reference, vanilla SMW uses channel #4 for 1DF9 and channel #6 for 1DFC. Make sure that the <code>!noSFX</code> define in <a href="../asm/UserDefines.asm" target="_blank">UserDefines.asm</a> is set to <code>!false</code>. Otherwise, sound effects will not be inserted into the final build, because the code to play them will not exist.</p>

<h2>Syntax for Sound Effects</h2>
<p>Sound effects can be written in syntax similar to song MML, or purely in hex commands. However, the MML syntax is prone to a lot of bugs, so it's preferable to use pure hex commands. Any command that has an MML syntax equivalent has it provided for reference only, but its use is discouraged.</p>

<p>It's important to note that sound effects play at a fixed tempo (t56), have no staccato (i.e. no silence between notes), and do not support ties (<code>^</code>) or rests (<code>r</code>). Ties and rests simply cause the last note to repeat.</p>

<p>Sound effects written in hex simply consist of a sequence of hex commands. Some commands only consist of values with no command identifier before them; what each of these values corresponds to is inferred by the compiler based on its order and/or value range.</p>
<br>
<p>The available commands are as follows:</p>
